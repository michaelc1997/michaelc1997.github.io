										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pylons.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I am a student at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science.</p>
								  My interests include:
									<li>Coding in C, C++, Python, Java</li>
									<li>Sabermetrics and their role in MLB team construction</li>
									<li>Playing video games</li>
									<li>Building PC's</li>
									<li>Playing the Piano</li>
								  </p>
									<p>When I was four years old, my family and I lived in a basement of an apartment building on Boylston Street in downtown Boston, a few blocks behind Fenway Park. At the time I had no idea why it would get so loud after dinner sometimes. Right before I turned five, I moved to a small town in upstate New York ten minutes away from Cooperstown called Oneonta. There I fell in love with the game of baseball. I played baseball throughout my childhood up until I moved to Virginia Beach in 2011, when I was about to start high school.
									</p>
									<p>Baseball took a back seat for me during my high school years because I discovered the limitless world of computer games. I started off with a PS2 as a kid, but something about playing games with a mouse and keyboard just fascinated me. The charm that PC gaming left on me caused me to learn how to build my own gaming computer. </p>
									<p>I took my first computer science class during my junior year of high school. Once again, I discovered what would turn out to be a great passion of mine. I decided to study computer science in college after I had graduated high school in 2015. I attended ODU from 2015-2017. I took a much needed break year from school in 2018 to pursue other interests. At the end of 2018 I decided to transfer to Virginia Tech, which is where my story is at right now.</p>
